Inspiration:I have been into photography and photomanipulation techniques for over a year now..and seem to enjoy it vehemently...just carrying the passion forward to a beautiful looking web app that serves the situation....

Deployment Credits: I chose vercel over netlify since i am used to it and feel more confident and tech savvy while deploying through its easy to use deployment process...

Technical Querries and assets Info: I have used HTML to structiure my site..CSS for overall styling and js for interactive features....the image assets are from a wonderful free stock site named unsplash...pixabay images also used in cases...

Hope you enjoy my little creation...

Cheers!
